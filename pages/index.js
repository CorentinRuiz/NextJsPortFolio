               <Paragraph> I am currently in my first year of engineering school in Nice and am looking for a 2-year apprenticeship contract to learn more about computer development in a company.
                           I am rigorous and persevering, I integrate easily into a team and I am quickly operational.
                           I am passionate about IT and would like to learn more and strengthen my skills.
