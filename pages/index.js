               <Paragraph> I am currently in my last year of engineering school in Nice and am looking for a contract as a software engineer or cloud engineer.
                           I am rigorous and persevering, I integrate easily into a team and I am quickly operational.
                           I am passionate about IT and would like to learn more and strengthen my skills.
